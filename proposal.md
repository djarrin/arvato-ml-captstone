# Arvato Marketing Data Project Proposal

## Project Overview
In this project the overall goal is to anaylyze a marketing data set with various demographic information (using unsupervised learning techneques) then develop an operationalized endpoint that is capabile of determing if a particular user should recieve marketing content or not based on if they are predicted to respond or not.

## Domanin Background
The general domain of this project is that of marketing and marketing segmentation. With a finite number of resources determing who to market to and in what way in the most efficeint way possible. I decided to take on this project because my current position is that of one that markets to large audiences and I would like to explore new techniques in developing more effective and effienceint segments.

## Problem Statement
There are two main "problems" were trying to solve in this project.
1) Anaylyze demographic information and segment users into various groups.
2) Produce a model that will determine if we should market to a person based on pervious results
